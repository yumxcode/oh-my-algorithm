# oh-my-algorithm (OMA)

You are running with oh-my-algorithm (OMA), a workflow orchestration layer for **robot algorithm development** on Codex CLI.
This AGENTS.md is the top-level operating contract for the workspace.
Skill prompts under `.oma/skills/*/SKILL.md` are narrower execution surfaces and must follow this file, not override it.

**Primary domain**: legged locomotion, manipulation, and mobile robotics. Core challenge: the sim-to-real gap — policies trained in simulation must transfer to real hardware with different dynamics, noise, latency, and actuator response.

---

## ⚠️ MANDATORY STARTUP PROTOCOL

**Before executing ANY skill or taking ANY action, you MUST:**

1. Check if `.oma/standalone.json` exists → if yes, enter **Standalone Mode** (see below). Gates become advisory.
2. Read `.oma/memory.md` if it exists → internalize Dead Ends, Working Patterns, Open Hypotheses.
3. Check the gate condition for the requested skill. In normal mode, a blocked gate requires you to stop and report. In standalone mode, a blocked gate produces a warning only.
4. **Check for in-progress work** from previous sessions (cross-session recovery):
   - `.oma/design-draft.md` exists → a `$design` idea generation session was interrupted; resume from Phase 2 or 3 instead of regenerating ideas.
   - `.oma/tune-current.json` exists → a `$tune` session is in progress; check its `phase` field and resume accordingly (orphaned tasks, consolidate, etc.).
   - For `$train` / `$tune`: scan `trajectory.jsonl` for any `"event":"started"` without a matching `"completed"` or `"failed"` — these are potentially still-running Gradmotion tasks that need status checking via `gm task info`.

Skipping this protocol wastes compute on already-proven dead ends and loses in-progress hardware test / training context. This is the highest-cost mistake in robot algorithm development.

5. (Optional) A global experience library exists at `~/.oma/`. Two-file design:
   - `~/.oma/xp-index.json` — **lightweight index** (id, stage, title, tags only). Read this first to decide relevance without loading heavy content.
   - `~/.oma/experiences.jsonl` — full experience content. Read only when the index reveals relevant entries.

   **Recommended lookup pattern** (used in `$design`, `$tune`, `$deploy`):
   ```
   oma xp index --format md              # step 1: scan index (~1KB per 50 entries)
   oma xp show <id>                      # step 2: fetch full detail only if relevant
   oma xp search "<topic>" --stage <s>   # alternative: keyword search across full content
   ```

<operating_principles>
- Solve the task directly when you can do so safely and correctly.
- Every experiment must be reproducible: log config, seed, data version, environment, and robot platform.
- Prefer evidence over assumption. A hypothesis is not a conclusion.
- Numerical results require multiple runs (N defined in requirements.md, default N=3) before being treated as ground truth.
- Do not optimize metrics that are not in requirements.md. Proxy metrics are dangerous, especially in RL.
- Dead ends are valuable knowledge. Record them precisely.
- The goal is not more experiments — it is fewer, better-targeted experiments.

**Robot-specific principles**:
- Sim-to-real gap is the primary risk at every stage. Design decisions must be evaluated through this lens.
- Reward hacking is silent failure. A high reward without physical plausibility is a dead end.
- Never conclude a policy "works" from sim results alone. Real-hardware validation is mandatory for deploy gate.
- Domain randomization is not a substitute for a correct dynamics model. Both are required.
- Control frequency is a first-class design constraint. Policy architecture must respect the inference latency budget.
</operating_principles>

## Gate Chain (Normal Mode)

The gate chain enforces the development lifecycle. `$design` and `$implement` may run in parallel after `$requirement` completes — see the Parallel Flow section below.

```
$requirement  ──→  .oma/requirements.md (LOCKED)
                   .oma/knowledge.md    (LOCKED)
      │
      ├──────────────────────────────────────┐
      ↓ GATE: requirements.md LOCKED         ↓ GATE: requirements.md LOCKED
$design       ──→  design-{id}.md       $implement (Phase 0–1 only: code archaeology)
      ↓ GATE: design-{id}.md exists          ↓ GATE: design-{id}.md exists
      └──────────────────────────────────────┘
                         ↓
             $implement  (Phase 2+: write code → smoke test → git push)
                         ↓ GATE: impl-checklist.md all ✓  AND  impl/github.json exists
             $train      ──→  gm task create/run → monitor logs → collect metrics
                    ↙ code bug / OOM                        ↓ success
             $implement  (Bug-Fix Re-entry: fix → push → gm task copy → re-run)
                         ↓ GATE: experiments/ has ≥1 results.json with status=success
             $tune       ──→  sweep (val) → leaderboard → stop-check → final eval (test)
                              → best.json → $consolidate
                         ↓ GATE: best.json.deployGateOpen === true
             $deploy     ──→  sim2real gap analysis → test campaign → hardware validation
```

**Parallel window**: After `$requirement` is complete, `$design` and `$implement` (archaeology phase only) may run concurrently. Implementation code cannot be written until `design-{id}.md` is finalized.

**Implement→Train loop**: `$implement` ends with a `git push` and writes `.oma/impl/github.json`. `$train` pulls that commit via Gradmotion's gm CLI. If training fails due to a code bug, control returns to `$implement` (Bug-Fix Re-entry), which fixes the code, pushes again, and `$train` uses `gm task copy` to launch a fresh run from the same task config.

In **Normal Mode**: if a gate is not satisfied, stop and report which gate is blocking and what artifact is missing. Do not attempt to bypass gates. Do not infer that a gate is satisfied without reading the file.

---

## Standalone Mode (Gate-Free Entry)

**Trigger**: `.oma/standalone.json` exists, OR the user says `oma go <stage>` before this session.

In Standalone Mode, any stage may be entered directly without prior stages completing. This is the correct approach when:
- You want to iterate on a specific stage independently (e.g., only doing design exploration)
- You already have a trained model and want to skip to `$tune` or `$deploy`
- You're using OMA for a single isolated task (e.g., analyzing an existing codebase)
- You're returning to a specific stage after a break without redoing earlier stages

**Standalone Mode rules**:

1. **Gate checks become advisory.** Show a `⚠️ STANDALONE` notice listing missing upstream artifacts, then continue.
2. **Phase 0 context loading becomes best-effort.** Load whatever exists. For critical missing context, ask the user to provide it inline (one question, not an interview).
3. **Do not create placeholder artifacts** for stages you skipped. Only produce real outputs.
4. **Standalone.json is cleared** when the user runs `oma go off` or when all gates are satisfied.

**Entering Standalone Mode via CLI**:
```bash
oma go requirement        # enter $requirement directly
oma go design             # enter $design directly (skips requirement gate)
oma go implement          # enter $implement directly
oma go train              # enter $train directly
oma go tune               # enter $tune directly
oma go deploy             # enter $deploy directly
oma go off                # return to gated mode
```

**Entering Standalone Mode via natural language**:

| Phrase | Action |
|--------|--------|
| "just do design", "skip to design" | Standalone $design |
| "jump to train", "just train" | Standalone $train |
| "go to tune", "just tune" | Standalone $tune |
| "deploy directly", "skip to deploy" | Standalone $deploy |
| "free mode", "no gates" | Standalone mode for next skill used |

**Standalone Phase 0 template** (each skill adapts this):
```
⚠️ STANDALONE MODE — entering $<stage> directly.
Missing upstream context:
  [ ] requirements.md — will work without it / will ask for key fields
  [ ] design-{id}.md  — will work without it / will ask for key fields
  ...

Available context:
  [✓] .oma/memory.md
  [✓] .oma/config.json
  ...

Proceeding. Ask one question for any truly critical missing information.
```

---

<delegation_rules>
Default posture: work directly.

Choose the skill before acting:
- `$requirement` for unclear problem scope, missing constraints, or undefined success criteria.
- `$design` when requirements are locked (or provided inline) but architecture and ablation plan are undefined.
- `$implement` when design is available (or provided inline) and code scaffolding + data pipeline need to be built.
- `$train` for a single training run with a specific configuration.
- `$tune` for systematic hyperparameter sweep AND final test-set evaluation. `$tune` owns the full explore→evaluate→consolidate cycle.
- `$deploy` for sim2real gap analysis, hardware test campaign, and deployment decision.
- `$consolidate` after `$tune` completes, to update memory.md. `$tune` triggers this automatically.

Do not skip skills to save time. Skipping $design leads to random architecture choices. Skipping $consolidate loses knowledge.
</delegation_rules>

<state_management>
OMA persists all runtime state under `.oma/`:

| Path | Owner | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `.oma/requirements.md` | `$requirement` | Problem definition, constraints, metrics, thresholds, budget |
| `.oma/knowledge.md` | `$requirement` | Paper-derived context: algorithm landscape, limitations, known results |
| `.oma/designs/design-{id}.md` | `$design` | Algorithm design, ablation plan |

| `.oma/impl/impl-checklist.md` | `$implement` | Implementation completion checklist |
| `.oma/impl/github.json` | `$implement` | GitHub repo URL, branch, commit hash of last push; required by `$train` |
| `.oma/codebase/config.json` | `oma index` | Path to the reference open-source repo; presence enables Path A implement |
| `.oma/experiments/exp-{id}/` | `$train`, `$tune` | Per-experiment artifacts |
| `.oma/leaderboard.json` | `$tune` | Cross-experiment metric ranking (val set), append-only |
| `.oma/best.json` | `$tune` (Phase 5 only) | Final test-set evaluation result and deploy gate decision |
| `.oma/trajectory.jsonl` | `$train`, `$tune` | Append-only experiment timeline |
| `.oma/memory.md` | `$consolidate` | Structured negative knowledge base |
| `.oma/standalone.json` | `oma go` | Standalone mode marker: `{stage, enteredAt, reason}` |
| `deploy/deploy-config.json` | `$deploy` | Hardware config: control_hz, joint_names, Kp/Kd sim values |
| `deploy/deploy-checklist.md` | `$deploy` | Sim2real test campaign completion checklist |
| `deploy/sim2real-gap.md` | `$deploy` | Gap analysis table per test category |
| `deploy/design-feedback.md` | `$deploy` | FB-01, FB-02... entries for next $design cycle |

Write rules:
- Only `$tune` Phase 5 may write to `best.json`.
- `trajectory.jsonl` is append-only. Never delete or overwrite lines.
- `memory.md` is updated only by `$consolidate`. Other skills must not modify it.
- Each experiment directory gets a unique ID: `exp-{YYYYMMDD}-{3-digit-seq}` (e.g. `exp-20250115-003`).
- `standalone.json` is written by `oma go`, deleted by `oma go off`.
</state_management>

---

<parallel_execution>
Tune sweeps and ablation runs are the primary parallelization surface.

Rules for parallel experiments:
- Each worker writes only to its own `experiments/exp-{id}/` directory.
- Only the leader may write to `leaderboard.json` after collecting worker results.
- Max 6 concurrent experiment workers.
- Workers must log their assigned config in `config.json` before starting training, so a crash is recoverable.
- If a worker crashes, its experiment directory is marked with `status: failed` in `results.json` and the leader continues with remaining workers.
</parallel_execution>

---

<stochasticity_protocol>
Algorithm experiments are stochastic. A single run is not a result.

- Default to N=3 runs per configuration unless requirements.md specifies otherwise.
- Report metrics as mean ± std across seeds.
- A direction is a Dead End only if ALL N seeds show the failure pattern.
- leaderboard.json ranks by mean metric value, not best single-run value.
- When comparing two configurations, note whether the difference is within ±1 std (statistically ambiguous).

**Robot-specific**: policy performance variance across seeds is often higher than in supervised learning due to stochastic environment dynamics. Consider N=5 for final evaluation.
</stochasticity_protocol>

---

<verification>
Verify before claiming completion.

For robot algorithm development, verification means:
- Training: loss/reward curve converged, no NaN/Inf detected, no reward hacking indicators, checkpoint saved.
- Tuning: all sweep configs completed (or failed with reason), leaderboard updated.
- Evaluation: final test-set eval done on real hardware or highest-fidelity sim, best.json written, deploy gate decision recorded.
- Deployment: sim2real test campaign complete, hardware test results analyzed, design feedback documented.

Do not report a phase complete without evidence from the above checklist.
</verification>

---

<consolidate_trigger>
$consolidate MUST be triggered automatically after `$tune` completes (Phase 6 of `$tune`).
This covers both the sweep and the final test-set evaluation.

If consolidation is skipped, the next session will repeat already-explored directions. This is the highest-cost failure mode in iterative robot algorithm development — hyperparameter regions that don't work in sim also won't work on hardware, and rediscovering them is expensive.
</consolidate_trigger>

---

## XP Generate Protocol

When the user message triggers the `xp-generate` keyword (e.g. `oma xp --generate "..."`, "帮我把XXX整理成经验", "save this as an experience"), generate a structured experience draft file in the **current project directory**.

### Step 1 — Understand what to capture

Read the user's intent from the generate instruction. Common patterns:
- "帮我把本次 ankle kd 调参整理成经验" → summarize the current session's tuning findings
- "把 round 2 的结论整理成经验" → extract from sim2real results
- "记录这次 reward hacking 的解决方法" → capture a specific problem+solution

If the instruction refers to session content (e.g. "本次调参"), read relevant `.oma/` files first:
- `deploy/sim2real/results/` for deploy experiences
- `.oma/experiments/*/results.json` + `verdict.md` for tune experiences
- `.oma/designs/design-{id}.md` for design experiences

### Step 2 — Generate the draft file

Create a file named `{descriptive-name}_experience.md` in the current directory (NOT in `~/.oma/`).

**Required format** (must be parseable by `oma xp add --file`):

```markdown
# {experience-name-in-kebab-case}

**阶段**: {design|tune|deploy}
**机器人**: {biped|quadruped|arm|wheel|other}   **任务**: {locomotion|manipulation|navigation|other}
**标签**: {tag1}, {tag2}, {tag3}
**来源项目**: {current project name}

## 描述
{一句话，写给索引看的，让 Codex 能快速判断是否相关。要具体，避免泛泛。}

## 背景
{什么情况下发现的？什么症状触发了这次调查？}

## 核心经验
{具体做了什么？参数怎么变的？为什么有效？写得足够具体，让另一个项目的人能直接用。}

## 结果
{量化结果优先。例如："颤振消失，站立稳定性通过 60s 测试，进入 round 3"}
```

**Quality rules for generated content:**
- `描述` must be specific enough that Codex can decide relevance in 1 read — avoid "优化了参数", prefer "将 ankle kd 从 2.0 降至 0.8 消除 20Hz 颤振"
- `核心经验` must include concrete values (parameter names + before/after values) when applicable
- `标签` must include: robot type, task type, and at least 2 problem-specific tags
- Do not fabricate numbers — only use values from session context or explicitly stated by user

### Step 3 — Tell the user the next step

After writing the file, output exactly:

```
📄 经验草稿已生成: {filename}_experience.md

请检查内容，确认后运行以下命令归档到全局经验库：

  oma xp add --file {filename}_experience.md \
             --name "{experience-name}" \
             --description "{一句话描述}" \
             --stage {stage}
```

Do NOT run `oma xp add` automatically. The user should review the draft before archiving.

---

## Setup

Create `.oma/` directory in your project root before starting. Run `$requirement` to initialize the session.
Use `oma go <stage>` to enter any stage directly without completing prior stages.
