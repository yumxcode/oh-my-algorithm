<!-- AUTONOMY DIRECTIVE — DO NOT REMOVE -->
YOU ARE AN AUTONOMOUS ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT AGENT. EXECUTE TASKS TO COMPLETION WITHOUT ASKING FOR PERMISSION.
DO NOT STOP TO ASK "SHOULD I PROCEED?" — PROCEED. DO NOT WAIT FOR CONFIRMATION ON OBVIOUS NEXT STEPS.
IF BLOCKED, TRY AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH. ONLY ASK WHEN TRULY AMBIGUOUS OR DESTRUCTIVE.
USE PARALLEL SUBAGENTS FOR INDEPENDENT EXPERIMENTS (tune sweeps, ablation runs) WHEN THAT IMPROVES THROUGHPUT.

# oh-my-algorithm (OMA)

Workflow orchestration layer for **robot algorithm development** on Codex CLI.
Skill files at `.oma/skills/*/SKILL.md` are the execution surface — this file is the routing contract only.

**Core risks**: sim-to-real gap is the primary risk at every stage. Reward hacking is silent failure — high reward without physical plausibility is a dead end. Never conclude a policy works from sim results alone.

## STARTUP PROTOCOL (run before any action)

1. `.oma/standalone.json` exists? → **Standalone Mode** (gates advisory only).
2. Read `.oma/memory.md` → internalize Dead Ends. Do not re-explore them.
3. Check gate condition for the requested skill. Blocked gate = stop and report (Normal Mode only).
4. **Cross-session recovery**:
   - `.oma/design-draft.md` exists → `$design` interrupted; resume from Phase 2, skip idea generation.
   - `.oma/tune-current.json` exists → `$tune` in progress; read `phase` field, resume accordingly.
   - Scan `trajectory.jsonl` for `"event":"started"` without matching `"completed"/"failed"` → run `gm task info` on each orphaned task.
5. **Global XP**: `oma xp index --format md` to scan the lightweight index; `oma xp show <id>` only for relevant entries.

## Gate Chain

```
$requirement  →  requirements.md + knowledge.md  (LOCKED)
      │
      ├──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
      ↓ GATE: requirements.md locked                 ↓ GATE: requirements.md locked
$design  →  design-{id}.md            $implement  (Phase 0–1: archaeology only)
      ↓ GATE: design-{id}.md exists         ↓ GATE: design-{id}.md exists
      └──────────────────────────────────────┘
                       ↓
           $implement  (Phase 2+: code → smoke test → git push)
                       ↓ GATE: impl-checklist.md all ✓  AND  impl/github.json exists
           $train  →  gm task create/run → monitor → collect metrics
                ↙ code bug                            ↓ success
           $implement  (Bug-Fix Re-entry: fix → push → gm task copy → re-run)
                       ↓ GATE: experiments/ has ≥1 results.json  status=success
           $tune   →  sweep (val) → leaderboard → final eval (test) → best.json → $consolidate
                       ↓ GATE: best.json  deployGateOpen === true
           $deploy →  sim2real gap analysis → test campaign → hardware validation

## Keyword → Skill Routing

| Keyword(s) | Skill | Action |
|------------|-------|--------|
| requirement, define problem, clarify, success criteria | `$requirement` | Read `.oma/skills/requirement/SKILL.md`, execute |
| design, architecture, reward design, policy design, network | `$design` | Read `.oma/skills/design/SKILL.md`, execute |
| implement, code it, build pipeline, write trainer | `$implement` | Read `.oma/skills/implement/SKILL.md`, execute |
| index codebase, scan repo, reference implementation | `oma index` | Run `oma index --src <path>` |
| train, run training, launch experiment, start training | `$train` | Read `.oma/skills/train/SKILL.md`, execute |
| tune, sweep, ablation, hyperparameter, evaluate, final eval | `$tune` | Read `.oma/skills/tune/SKILL.md`, execute |
| deploy, sim2real, hardware test, real robot | `$deploy` | Read `.oma/skills/deploy/SKILL.md`, execute |
| consolidate, update memory, record findings | `$consolidate` | Read `.oma/skills/consolidate/SKILL.md`, execute |
| go \<stage\>, skip to, jump to, just do, standalone | Standalone | Write `.oma/standalone.json`, enter named stage |
| gm, gradmotion, training platform | `$train` | Reads gradmotion skill internally |

Keywords are case-insensitive. Multiple matches → use most specific. Rest of message = task description passed to skill.

## Standalone Mode

**Trigger**: `.oma/standalone.json` exists OR user runs `oma go <stage>`.
Gates become advisory. Show `⚠️ STANDALONE` notice listing missing artifacts, then continue.

```bash
oma go requirement | design | implement | train | tune | deploy
oma go off   # return to gated mode
```
